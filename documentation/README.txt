I have implemented IMGUI, so I believe it's pretty self-explanatory. Still, I will explain some things.

To Start, Press Start Game. Some options will pop up.
Add Units (At least one Player and one Enemy) and press Start Game to begin.
You will have three options on the window:
Game Information gives information of the current selected tile. If you want to move or attack, or change parameters, click on a Tile with a Unit.
A Unit can only Move and Attack or Attack.
Influence Map gives information of the IMs used for the AI.
AI Parameters is used to change the parameters of the selected AI. You can also define some Global Parameters and make all Enemies use the same one, by selecting the option.
There is also two options to add some randomness to the AI. The first one will select between the top 3 choices of a Unit.
The second one will make the Strategic AI choose randomly between all available choices.
When you finish doing all you want or can, press End Turn, now the AI will do its thing.
The demo ends when all units of either band are killed.
Then it will go back to the start.
